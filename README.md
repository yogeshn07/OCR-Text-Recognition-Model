# 📇 Visiting Card OCR Extraction System

## 🔍 Overview
The Visiting Card OCR Extraction System is a privacy-first backend application that extracts structured contact information from visiting card images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and intelligent text parsing techniques.

The system accepts an image of a business card and returns meaningful, machine-readable data such as name, designation, company, phone number, email address, website, physical address, detected language, and an overall confidence score.

The project is implemented as a RESTful API using FastAPI and runs completely offline, making it suitable for environments where data privacy is critical 🔐.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a pipeline-based architecture where each stage performs a specific task.

**Flow:**  
Image Input → Image Preprocessing → OCR Engine → Text Parsing → Confidence Calculation → JSON Output

**Detailed Steps:**
1. The client uploads a visiting card image (multipart or base64).
2. The image is preprocessed to improve OCR accuracy.
3. OCR is performed using Tesseract or PaddleOCR.
4. Raw text is parsed to extract structured fields.
5. A confidence score is calculated.
6. The final structured JSON response is returned.
